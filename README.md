# ðŸ§  Student-Teacher Framework for Real-Time Video Restoration

This project implements a lightweight **student model** trained using a high-performing **Restormer teacher model** through knowledge distillation. The system is designed to restore degraded video frames caused by low-bandwidth conditions such as motion blur, compression, and resolution lossâ€”common in online classrooms or low-quality calls.

The student model is real-time and optimized for deployment on low-end devices, while the teacher model ensures high restoration fidelity.

## ðŸ“¦ Restormer Checkpoint (Required)

To train or evaluate using the teacher model (`Restormer`), you must download the pretrained weights:

ðŸ”— [Download Restormer Deblurring `.pth` file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TDzcqvoNJS54yk7RSC-pco__HB4E32pz/view?usp=drive_link)

## Working & Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation**

- **Download Data:**  
  Run:
  ```bash
  python download_data.py
  ```
  This script downloads and organizes public datasets (e.g., DIV2K, Unsplash) into the `data/` folder.

- **Extract Data:**  
  If your data is in compressed or raw format, run:
  ```bash
  python extract_data.py
  ```
  This will extract and organize the images into the correct subfolders.

- **Generate Patches:**  
  For efficient training, generate patches from the full images:
  ```bash
  python generate_patches.py
  ```
  This creates `input_patches/` and `target_patches/` in `data/train/`.

- **Simulate Blur:**  
  To create blurred images for training/testing, use:
  ```bash
  python blur.py
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  python generate_test_input_blur.py
  ```

### 2. **Restormer Teacher Model**

- The `Restormer/` directory is sourced from the official [Restormer repository](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer) ([CVPR 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09881)).
- It contains the code and pretrained weights for the teacher model, which is state-of-the-art for image restoration tasks such as motion deblurring, deraining, and denoising.
- For more details, see the [Restormer README](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer/blob/main/README.md).

### 3. **Model Training**

- **Train the Student Model:**  
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```
  This script performs multi-stage training using knowledge distillation from the teacher (Restormer). It automatically handles checkpointing and resumes if interrupted.

### 4. **Testing & Evaluation**

- **Test the Student Model:**  
  ```bash
  python test_student.py
  ```

- **Test the Teacher Model:**  
  ```bash
  python test_restormer_teacher.py
  ```

- **Evaluate Performance:**  
  ```bash
  python evaluate.py
  ```
  Computes SSIM, PSNR, and other metrics on the test set.

- **Benchmark Speed:**  
  ```bash
  python benchmark_model_fps.py
  ```

### 5. **Subjective Evaluation (MOS Study)**

- Conduct a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) study using the outputs and the provided Excel or script templates in `MOS_evaluation/`.
